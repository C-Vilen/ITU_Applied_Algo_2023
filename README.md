# My work for the course in Applied Algorithms of Autumn 2023
The course in Applied Algorithms covered how to implement some widely-used algorithms as fast and scalable programs on modern hardware, and how to evaluate the implementations using appropriate test cases and performance experiments.

## Course projects & assignments
| Project/Assignment      | Description |
|    :----:   |    :----:   |
| [ThreeFourSum](/ThreeFourSum/)      | This project was the base for understanding and evaluating an algorithm.|
| [BitOperations](/BitOperations/)   | This assignment was used to introduce us to work wtih bits and bytes and prepare us for the HyperLogLog project.|
| [HyperLogLog](/HyperLogLog/)   | This project introduced us to a more complex (probalistic counting) algorithm and the use of Hashing and "buckets".|
